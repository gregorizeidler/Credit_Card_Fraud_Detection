# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Description
This project implements a fraud detection system for credit card transactions using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. The system includes an interactive web interface built with Streamlit to facilitate data analysis, visualization, and model-driven insights.

## Features
- Exploratory analysis of transaction data
- Feature engineering for fraud detection
- Training and comparison of multiple ML models
- Interactive visualizations and dashboards
- Model explainability with SHAP and LIME techniques
- Risk threshold adjustments for fraud detection
- Real-time transaction monitoring and inference

## Technical Features

### Processing Pipelines
The system uses `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` to create reproducible processing flows:
- Consistent data preprocessing
- Transformation of categorical and numerical features
- Automatic extraction of temporal characteristics
- Use of SMOTE for class balancing

### Model Registry System
A complete model versioning system has been implemented:
- Storage of multiple model versions
- Registration of hyperparameters and performance metrics
- Traceability of used features
- API to select the best model by metric

### Advanced Features for Fraud Detection
We implemented advanced features specific to fraud:
- Transaction velocity analysis
- Behavioral pattern detection
- Temporal anomaly identification
- Composite fraud risk score

### Responsive Interface
The Streamlit application has a modern and responsive interface:
- Interactive dashboard with dark theme
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Risk threshold adjustments with immediate visual feedback
- Transaction fraud scoring with detailed explanations

## Dataset
The project includes a sample fictitious credit card transaction dataset containing:
- Transaction information (amount, date, status)
- Merchant data (ID, category, location)
- Card information (brand, issuing bank)
- Fraud indicator (target)

Users can upload their own data or use the built-in synthetic data generator.

## Implemented Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Model Ensemble (Voting)
